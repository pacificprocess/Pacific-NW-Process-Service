		<h3>SKIP TRACE/LOCATE</h3>
		
		<p>We are known for our ability to track down even the most elusive individuals. We are schooled and experienced in the art of locate and missing person investigation and our company is proud to acknowledge an above average success rate. Rest assured, we can help you locate and make contact with the people you want to find.</p>

		<h4>How do we locate people?</h4>
		<p>We have access to thousands of databases nationwide with millions of names and addresses. These include driver records, consumer profiles, social security data, post office forwarding data, mailing lists, magazine subscriptions, fish and game licensing, voter records, utility records, reverse telephone directories, real property records, and a host of other public and proprietary databases. Some states restrict access to certain databases.</p>

		<h4>Difference between Missing Persons, Skip Tracing, and Location Investigations</h4>
		
		<p>Generally, Skip Tracing is to find people who may not be in harm’s way and typically need to be found to collect a debt or be sought for questioning regarding a transaction or event The term comes from the debt collection industry and refers to those who “skip out” on their debts by moving and not leaving a forwarding address.</p>

		<p>Today the term skip tracing has been adapted to mean finding a missing person, regardless of if they have skipped out on a debt. The insurance industry uses skip tracing for a variety of reasons, most often to locate a claimant, insured or witness.</p>

		<p>We encourage our clients obtain and forward as much identifying information as possible on subjects they need found. The more information we are supplied upon assignment of a case the better the potential is that we will locate the subject sooner than later. This includes current / past addressees, Social Security numbers, dates of birth and names of family members and other relatives. In some cases a photograph of the subject may be requested.</p>

		<h4>Locating Witnesses / Interviewing Witnesses</h4>
		<p>Witnesses are always important. Right after an event, you need to figure out who knows what. Months and years later they may have moved and forgotten to tell you. The investigator has special insight into techniques of locating, finding, and obtaining statements from witnesses.</p>

		<h4>Various Skip Tracing Techniques</h4>
		<p>It can be very frustrating to skip-trace an individual. We offer a simple productivity shift, by having a specialist complete two phases of the locating process. First, we search for data or Information. Secondly, we rely on field investigation. With these two tracks we can solve even the most difficult skip tracing assignments.</p>
