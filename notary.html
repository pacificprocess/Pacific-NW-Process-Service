		<h3>MOBILE NOTARY</h3>
		
		<p>If you need a mobile notary in Washington, you’ll know by the language on your forms. At the end of the form, there should be a place for a notary’s signature and seal. Some documents call for a witness, and a notary can serve this purpose, too. Most documents and forms that are filed with the court require a notary.</p>
