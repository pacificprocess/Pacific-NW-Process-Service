		<h4>Who should hire a Private Investigator?</h4>
		<p>A great variety of people can benefit from the services of a private investigator, depending upon their situation. For example, an investigator is an invaluable member of your legal team for child custodies, personal injury and civil litigation, providing your attorney with information critical to winning your case. An investigator can conduct interviews, take witness statements, and provide surveillance, all in support of your litigation. Investigators are also used to locate missing persons, perform asset searches, conduct criminal investigations, to name a few. Investigators also provide valuable services to businesses in providing background investigations, undercover operations, fraud investigations and workplace security.</p>
		
		<h4>What can I expect to pay?</h4>
		<p>Plan on between $65 and $95 per hour plus costs and mileage for most cases. You may be able to hire an investigator for less, but beware of letting cost alone be the determining factor.</p>
		
		<h4>How can I expect the investigator to handle my case?</h4>
		<p>A reputable investigator will provide you with the highest standard of investigative service and will extend every effort to obtain the information necessary for your case. Do not expect your investigator to do anything that would compromise his ethical standards. A good investigator will do all his work in a professional, legal and ethical manner. Beyond that, you should expect to be treated courteously, to have your phone calls returned promptly, to be provided with an itemized statement and to receive a high-quality, professionally-written report, should you request one.</p>
