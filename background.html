		<h3>BACKGROUND CHECKS</h3>
		
		<p>The practice of conducting effective background checks/employment screenings for prospective employers or on people of interest has exploded over the last 15 years. Regarding employee hiring practices, the need to hire the most qualified candidate, and the risk in hiring the wrong candidate, has never been greater. Workplace crime, unethical business practices and misleading resume information are on the rise. The costs of not performing proper employment background checks for fraud, embezzlement, theft and or violence are a multi-billion dollar drain on our economy for organizations both large and small.</p>

		<p>In the same manner, having a plaintiff or defendant’s criminal background check during or prior to legal proceedings may become helpful in determining a claims validity or possible weaknesses. This knowledge could be a great asset if mediation, arbitration or a trial date is in the future.</p>

		<h4>What is an effective method for conducting a background check?</h4>
		
		<p>No Subject or Applicant will ever be the same, therefore Individual Records needing to be checked can vary. There is no one set way of conducting all background checks. We research every nook and cranny along with spending an extensive amount of time reviewing every avenue and every database available to us to produce conlusive results for you.<p>

		<p>The term “Background Check” can refer to a wide array of services and practices, but there are some basics that must be followed in order to obtain the most accurate, current and concise information. To begin, the county courthouse records should be checked in the states your subject has resided over the past 7-10 years. It is also acceptable and recommended to check maiden and alias names in each county as well.</p>

		<p>A background check can verify that the information you have gotten from the potential employee, tenant, or individual(s) is accurate or it may reveal significant discrepancies, but can help you make an informed decision.</p>

		<p>No Background Investigation would be complete without a search of the subject’s Social Media footprint. Our team offers a Deep Social Media report that is extremely detailed and easy to read. Please call or email us for more information.</p>

		<p>Once we obtain all of the information we generate a report to you, now you will have the physical proof for the person involved, so you will be armed with all the information needed to make an informed decision.</p>
